### The keyword `this`
- A reserved keyword in JavaScript

- Usually determined by how a function is called (what we call 'execution context')

- Can be determined using four rules (global, object/implicit, explicit, new)

#### 1 - Global Context

When you see `this` keyword outside of a "declared object"(there has not been an object defined which contains the keyword `this`.).

Think the `this` is in the wild. When we see the keyword `this` in the global context. It's a value refer's to the global object which in the browser is the `window` object.

In fact every variable that you declare in the global scope is actually attached to the `window` object.

e.g. in the chrome console
```
var person = "Sean"
window.person // Sean
window.person === person //true
```

e.g. Inside of a declared object.

```
var data = {};
data.instructor = "Sean"; // "Sean"
data //obj {instructor: Sean}
```

e.g.
We are attaching a property onto a keyword this called person and setting it equal to "Sean".
Since the keyword `this` refer to the global object. Anything we attached onto it becomes a global variable
which means we can use it outside of the function. This is a bad practices.

```
console.log(this) // window

function whatIsThis(){
    return this
}

function variablesInThis(){
    // since the value of this is the window
    // all we are doing here is creating a global variable
    this.person = "Sean"
}

console.log(person) // Sean

whatIsThis() // window
```

##### Strict Mode
```
"use strict"	//enable strict mode.
```

After enable strict mode, the value of the keyword `this` when inside of a function is undefined. It's not the global object.

```
"use strict"

console.log(this) // window

function whatIsThis(){
    return this
}

function variablesInThis(){
    // since we are in strict mode this is undefined
    // so what happens if we add a property on undefined?
    // let's see what happens when we call the function...
    this.person = "Elie"
}

variablesInThis() // TypeError, can't set person on undefined! 

whatIsThis() // undefined
```
#### 2 - Implicit / Object rule
When the keyword `this` is inside of a declared object. The value of the keyword `this` will always be the closest parent object.

e.g.
```
var person = {
    firstName: "Elie",
    sayHi: function(){
        return "Hi " + this.firstName
    },
    determineContext: function(){
        return this === person
    }
}
```
```
person.sayHi() // "Hi Elie"
```
```
person.determineContext() // true
```

What should the keyword 'this' refer to here?
```
var person = {
    firstName: "Elie",
    determineContext: this;
}
```
```
person.determineContext; // window
```
A keyword 'this' is defined when a function is run! There is not a function being run here to create a new value of the keyword 'this' so the value of 'this' is still the window!

What happens when we have a nested object?
```
var person = {
    firstName: "Colt",
    sayHi: function(){
        return "Hi " + this.firstName;
    },
    determineContext: function(){
        return this === person;
    },
    dog: {
        sayHello: function(){
            return "Hello " + this.firstName;
        },
        determineContext: function(){
            return this === person;
        }        
    }
}
```
```
person.sayHi() // "Hi Colt"
person.determineContext() // true

// but what is the value of the keyword this right now?
person.dog.sayHello() // "Hello undefined"
person.dog.determineContext() // false
```

#### 3 - Explicit binding
Choose what we want the context of `this` to be using `call`, `apply` or `bind`

NAME OF METHOD | PARAMETERS	| INVOKE IMMEDIATELY?
-------------- | ---------- | -------------------
Call | thisArg, a, b, c, d , ... | Yes
Apply | thisArg, [a,b,c,d, ...] | Yes
Bind | thisArg, a, b, c, d , ...	| No

##### Fixing up with `call`
```
var person = {
    firstName: "Colt",
    sayHi: function(){
        return "Hi " + this.firstName
    },
    determineContext: function(){
        return this === person
    },
    dog: {
        sayHello: function(){
            return "Hello " + this.firstName
        },
        determineContext: function(){
            return this === person
        }        
    }
}
```

```
person.sayHi() // "Hi Colt"
person.determineContext() // true

person.dog.sayHello.call(person) // "Hello Colt"
person.dog.determineContext.call(person) // true

// Using call worked! Notice that we do NOT invoke sayHello or determineContext
```

e.g. Using Call in the Wild
```
var colt = {
    firstName: "Colt",
    sayHi: function(){
        return "Hi " + this.firstName 
    }
}

var elie = {
    firstName: "Elie",
    // Look at all this duplication :(
    sayHi: function(){
        return "Hi " + this.firstName 
    }
}

colt.sayHi() // Hi Colt
elie.sayHi() // Hi Elie (but we had to copy and paste the function from above...)

// How can we refactor the duplication using call? 

// How can we "borrow" the sayHi function from colt 
// and set the value of 'this' to be elie?
```
solution
```
var colt = {
	firstName: "Colt",
	sayHi: function(){
		return "Hi " + this.firstName
	}
}

var elie = {
	firstName: "Elie"
}

colt.sayHi() //Hi Colt
colt.sayHi.call(elie); //Hi Elie
```
Let's make a new function to sayHi to everyone
```
function sayHi(){
    return "Hi " + this.firstName;
}

var colt = {
	firstName: "Colt"
}
var elie = {
	firstName: "Elie"
}

sayHi.call(colt); //Hi Colt
sayHi.call(elie); //Hi Elie
```

Another Use Case For Call
Let's imagine we want to select all the 'divs' on a page
```
var divs = document.getElementsByTagName('divs');
```
How can we find all the divs that have the text "Hello". Using filter would be nice!
```
divs.filter // undefined
```
Unfortunately, divs is not an array, it's an array like object so filter won't work.
So how can we convert an array-like-object into an array?
Very similar to the way we make copies of arrays - using slice!

How can we do this?
call to the rescue!

Let's use the slice method on arrays, but instead of the target of slice (the keyword this) being that array, let's set the target of the keyword `this` to be our divs array-like-object.
```
var divsArray = [].slice.call(divs);
// you might also see this as Array.prototype.slice.call(divs) 
// they do the same thing
```
```
divsArray.filter(function(val){
    return val.innerText === 'Hello';
});
```
What we are doing is trying to slice something that is not actually an array! In JavaScript, slice will not work on all data types, but it works very well on array-like-objects

##### What about `apply`? 
*It's almost identical to call - except the parameters!*

```
var colt = {
	firstName: "Colt",
	sayHi: function(){
		return "Hi " + this.firstName
	},
	addNumbers: function(a,b,c,d){
		return this.firstName + " just calculated " + (a+b+c+d);
	} 
}

var elie = {
	firstName: "Elie"
}

colt.sayHi() // Hi Colt
colt.saiHi.apply(elie);  //Hi Elie
// well this seems the same....but what happens when we start adding arguments?

colt.addNumbers(1,2,3,4) // Colt just calculated 10
colt.addNumbers.call(elie,1,2,3,4) // Elie just caculated 10
colt.addNumbers.apply(elie,[1,2,3,4]) // Elie just calculated 10


```
##### When to use apply
When a function does not accept an array, apply will spread out values in an array for us!

```
var nums = [5,7,1,4,2];

Math.max(nums); // NaN 

Math.max.apply(this, nums); // 7

function sumValues(a,b,c){
    return a+b+c;
}

var values = [4,1,2];

sumValues(values); // "4,1,2undefinedundefined"

sumValues.apply(this,[4,1,2]); // 7
```

#### What about `bind`?
*The parameters work like call, but bind returns a Function Definition with the context of 'this' bound already!*

*Function definition:*
```
var sayHi = function(){return "Hi"}
sayHi <= function definition
```

```
var colt = {
    firstName: "Colt",
    sayHi: function(){
        return "Hi " + this.firstName 
    },
    addNumbers: function(a,b,c,d){
        return this.firstName + " just calculated " + (a+b+c+d);
    }
}

var elie = {
    firstName: "Elie"
}
```

```
var elieCalc = colt.addNumbers.bind(elie,1,2,3,4) // function(){}...
elieCalc() // Elie just calculated 10
```

```
// With bind - we do not need to know all the arguments up front!

var elieCalc = colt.addNumbers.bind(elie,1,2) //Function definition, partial application
elieCalc(3,4) // Elie just calculated 10  
```

Bind in the wild
e.g. Tricky example
```
var colt = {
    firstName: "Colt",
    sayHi: function(){
        setTimeout(function(){
            console.log("Hi " + this.firstName)
        },1000)
    }
}
```
```
colt.sayHi() // Hi undefined (1000 milliseconds later)
```
In this example, `this` not refer to the parent object. It actually refer to the global object.
Since the `setTimeout` is called at a later point in time, the object that it is attached to is actually the `window`,
just likewe said before `setTimeout` is a method on the `window` object even though it's defined inside of the cold object
When it's declared, the context in which the function is executed is actually the global context.

*Use bind to set the correct context of 'this'*
```
// we can use bind(colt) to achieve the same purpose, however if we need use this method in other function like elie.sayHi,  
// the entire variable will break. So we are more commonly use 'this'. 
var colt = {
    firstName: "Colt",
    sayHi: function(){
        setTimeout(function(){
            console.log("Hi " + this.firstName);
        }.bind(this),1000)
    }
}
```
```
colt.sayHi() // Hi Colt (1000 milliseconds later)
```

**To recap we saw that the bind method returns a function definition unlike `call` and `apply` and it's very useful for setting**
**the value of the keyword `this`**
 - **when we do not know all of the values for arguments to pass to the function.**
 - **when we are working with asynchronous code.**


#### 4 - The 'new' keyword

We can set the context of the keyword 'this' using the 'new' keyword - it does quite a bit more as well which we will discuss further when we talk about OOP
e.g.
```
function Person(firstName, lastName){
    this.firstName = firstName
    this.lastName = lastName
    //the value of the keyword this is the global object.
}
```
```
var elie = new Person("Elie", "Schoppik");
//The value of the keyword `this` changes when we use the `new` keyword.
```
```
elie.firstName // "Elie"
elie.lastName // "Schoppik"
```
The keyword `this` now refers to an object that is created when the `new` keyword is used
We are storing that object in a variable called elie and can then access the first name and last name properties on it.

**RECAP**
- **The keyword 'this' is a reserved keyword in JavaScript and its value is determined at execution**
- **It is either set using the global context, object binding, explicit binding, or the new keyword**
- **When set in the global context in a function, it is either the global object (window if in the browser) or undefined (if we are using strict mode)**
- **To explicitly set the value of the keyword 'this', we use call, apply, or bind**
- **We can also use the 'new' keyword to set the context of 'this', which we will discuss when we talk about Object Oriented Programming**
